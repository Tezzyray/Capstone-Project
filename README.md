# Supermarket Customer Value Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict high-value customers from supermarket customer data using machine learning. The dataset includes customer demographic and spending information, and the model predicts whether a customer is a high-value customer based on their spending score. A high-value customer is defined as one with a Spending Score of 50 or above.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Genre`: Categorical variable indicating gender (encoded as 0 and 1).
- `Age`: Age of the customer.
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Customer’s annual income in thousand dollars.
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned based on customer behavior and spending patterns.
- `high_value`: Target variable indicating whether a customer is high-value (1) or not (0).

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Missing value checks and exploratory data analysis including histograms and correlation matrices.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created the `high_value` feature based on the Spending Score.
- **Modeling**: Applied a `RandomForestRegressor` to predict customer value.
- **Model Evaluation**: Used metrics like R-Squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and cross-validation for model performance evaluation.

## Visualizations
- **Spending Score Distribution**: Visualizes the distribution of customer spending scores.
- **Annual Income Distribution**: Displays the distribution of annual incomes.
- **Pairplot**: Shows the relationships between different features.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Visualizes the correlations between features using a heatmap.
- **Annual Income vs Spending Score**: Plots both variables on a dual-axis plot for comparison.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the project:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Model Training and Evaluation
The model pipeline includes:
1. **Preprocessing**: 
   - `OneHotEncoder` for encoding the categorical `Genre` feature.
   - `StandardScaler` for scaling the numerical features.
2. **Random Forest Regressor**: Used to predict the high-value customer class.

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **R-Squared**: 0.99998
- **Mean Absolute Error**: 0.0005
- **Mean Squared Error**: 0.000005

Additionally, cross-validation was performed, yielding an average R-Squared score of 0.9991.

## Results
The model achieved near-perfect predictions on the test set, indicating that the features chosen were highly effective in predicting high-value customers.

## Usage
Run the script to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate the performance:
```python
python customer_value_prediction.py
```

## Future Work
- Fine-tune the model by experimenting with other algorithms.
- Explore additional features that may improve prediction accuracy.
- Implement a more comprehensive customer segmentation analysis.
